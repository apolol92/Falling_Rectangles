# Falling_Rectangles
A mini game controlled by your voice.  
It was just a test for speech recognization.  

# Preperation
- Add to folder left about 10 spoken words 'left' and do the same for the right folder with 'right'
- Now we need 1 reference word for 'left' and 1 reference word for 'right'.. add those to the reference folder  
  
Use for voice recording the WAV format.
To do this in Windows:  
Go to Start, type soundrecorder /file outputfile.wav in the Start search box, and then press ENTER.

# Ingame
- Use 'v' to speak 'left' or 'right' to move your bat.

# Optimization
- Add more comments (sorry.. it was just a fast experiment)
- Better gamedesign.. sorry this little "game" should only test the possibilities of classic voice recognization..
