# Falling_Rectangles
A mini game controlled by your voice..

# Preperation
- Add your own voice to the folders 'left' and 'right' [wav-format]
- Change the files in reference_words
- Add more comments (sorry.. it was just a fast experiment)
- Better gamedesign.. sorry this little "game" should only test the possibilities of classic voice recognization..

# Ingame
- Use 'v' to speak 'left' or 'right' to move your bat.
